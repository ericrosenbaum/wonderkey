This is a project with @bmcfee from the Monthly Music Hackathon:

This project lets you play the song "Superstition" as an instrument. We took the multitrack stems, ran them through some analysis to segment out the individual notes, and mapped those onto the keyboard so you can trigger them. The samples are sorted so that each key triggers a randomly selected sample with a particular pitch. You can select from 6 tracks to control (for kick drum, drum kit, bass, horns, vocals, clavinet). The can play along with the full mix, with the track you're controlling muted.
